A FTP client running on another computer can connect with the FTP server and download, upload or delete files on the FTP server.\r\n\r\nPassword-protected read-write and/or anonymous read-only access are possible. FTP and SFTP (secure TLS/SSLv3 encryption) are supported. The server can be configured, started and stopped from a simple UI or via commandline.\r\n\r\n### Feeback\r\n\r\nIf you found bugs or have ideas for improvements please use the \"Issues\" link above to add an entry to the issue-tracker and describe exactly a) what is the problem, b) how can I reproduce it so I can fix it. or in the case of a feature-request please add as much information as possible what you expect should be different and how it should be different.\r\n\r\nPlease do NOT mail me with such things. I do not have time to keep track of things and it may take a while till I am able to address something. Please use the issue-tracker!\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\nmeeftpserver uses Qt5 QtQuick for the UI, Qt C++ for the integration and helper functionality and Python for the backend. The FTP-server functionality is implemented using the famous python-based pyftplib ( http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/ ).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nmeeftpserver is available under LGPLv2.1 or higher.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
